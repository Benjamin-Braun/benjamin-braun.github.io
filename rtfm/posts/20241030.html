			<h1>I'm switching to sourcehut</h1>
			<hr>
		</header>

		<p>Long time, no see; Yes, I haven't really written much. But, I never thought I'd write much at all.</p>

		<h2>Reason(s)</h2>
		<p>Since Microsoft acquired GitHub I've been looking for an good alternative. After I found out about sourcehut, mainly thorugh aerc - my email client - I decided, after some consideration, to switch to sourcehut. Also, I like the more simpler design of sourcehut. Also the project-system and the overall experience.</p>

		<h2>Consequences</h2>
		<p>Not really much will change; some repo's will just be at sourcehut. Some will remain on GitHub, like this website. Also, the GitHub link in the footer is changed to a sourcehut link.</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>I justed wanted to let y'all know, so have a great day!</p>
