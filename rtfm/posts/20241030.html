			<h1>I'm switching to sourcehut</h1>
			<hr>
		</header>

		<p>Long time, no see; Yes, I haven't really written much. But, I never thought I'd write much at all.</p>
		
		<h2>Reason(s)</h2>
		<p>Since Microsoft acquired GitHub I've been looking for an good alternative. After I found out about sourcehut, mainly thorugh aerc - my email client - I decided, after some consideration, to switch to sourcehut. Also, I like the more simpler design of sourcehut. Also the project-system and the overall experience.</p>

		<h2>Consequences</h2>
		<p>Not really much will change; The repository's will just be at sourcehut. Although this website will remain on GitHub, but it's the only thing remaining on GitHub. Also, the GitHub link in the footer is changed to a sourcehut link, as well as every link in the <i>projects</i> page.</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>
		<p>I justed wanted to let y'all know, so have a great day!</p>
